          My journey as a developer began with curiosity and a passion for learning.
          I was fascinated by how websites worked â€” why users click certain elements,
          how data flows behind the scenes, and what makes a digital experience smooth and intuitive.
          Over time, this curiosity evolved into a mission to build clean, functional, and delightful user interfaces.
